# Glossary

**Clover** - this is the bootloader we'll be using.  Real macs have a custom firmware that allows them to boot macOS.  PC hardware needs a little help to get this working; Clover helps us achieve that.  It also handles kext injection, ACPI renames, kext patches, and a ton of other functions.

**Kext** - the word "kext" is actually the combination of **K**ernel **Ext**ension; and you can think of kexts simply as drivers for macOS.

**config.plist** -  this is the file that tells Clover what to do.  It's an XML formatted property list \(looks very similar to HTML\) and is one of the most important parts of setting up your Hackintosh.

**OOB** -  an acronym for _Out Of the Box_ that implies working support without tweaking.
