# Getting Started

## What's Hackintosh?

When Apple announced their switch away from the PowerPC architecture to Intel's processors and chipsets, many were looking forward to having the ability to run Windows software on Apple hardware and Apple's operating systems on their non-Apple hardware. Apple was able to eventually build their Boot Camp feature in Mac OS X 10.5, later allowing Windows to run on Apple hardware. Those hoping to easily run Mac OS X on a standard PC didn't have it so easy.

Even though running Mac OS X on a generic PC is not supported by Apple, it is possible to accomplish given the right hardware and determination by users. Any system that is not made to run the Apple operating system is referred to as Hackintosh. This term comes from the fact that the software needs to be hacked to properly run on Non-Apple hardware. Of course, some of the hardware needs to be tweaked in a few cases as well.
